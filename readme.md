### Assignment 1 - Amazing Products

This project was actually really good as a intro to kotlin and connnecting the different parts. It took me a while to fully understand all the different parts and hook everything up.

I now feel like I'm much more comfortable creating a new project and actually knowing where everything is and how everything is connected together.
